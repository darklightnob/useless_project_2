üöÄ How To Run
There are two ways to run this project:

1. The Simple Way (Single File)

Download the alien-alert.html file that contains all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Open the file directly in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

That's it! The project will run.

2. The Developer Way (Separate Files with a Live Server)

This is the standard method for web development and is required if you use the separate index.html, style.css, and script.js files.

Install a Code Editor: If you don't have one, download and install Visual Studio Code.

Get the "Live Server" Extension:

In VS Code, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).

Search for Live Server by Ritwick Dey and click Install.

Set Up Files:

Create a folder for the project.

Place index.html, style.css, and script.js inside it.

Run the Server:

Open the project folder in VS Code.

Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server".

A browser tab will open automatically with the project running.
