Project Description
Finally, a global alien alert system that does absolutely nothing. Click the Earth, feel important for a second, and then go about your day. You've earned it.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The world lives in constant, crippling anxiety from not knowing if a UFO is hovering over a specific continent right now. How can anyone focus on their work or enjoy a meal with this cosmic uncertainty looming over them?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We have developed a state-of-the-art, browser-based 3D globe that allows any user to take global security into their own hands. By simply clicking on a continent, you can initiate a highly sophisticated anomaly detection sequence, which may or may not confirm the presence of a non-terrestrial visitor who is politely asking for permission before probing anything.

Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used
For Software:

Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Frameworks: None, this is pure, unadulterated code.

Libraries: Three.js

Tools: Visual Studio Code, Live Server

For Hardware:

A computer with a mouse. A keyboard is optional but recommended for looking busy.

An internet connection to download the Earth.

Implementation
For Software:

Installation
No installation is required. The project can be run from a single HTML file or via a local server.

Run
Method 1: Single File

Download the all-in-one .html file.

Open it in any modern web browser.

Method 2: Local Server (Recommended for development)

Install Visual Studio Code and the Live Server extension.


Right-click index.html in VS Code and select "Open with Live Server".
